🌐What is Microservice?

🔸Microservice - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services like database, server or a UI of the application, that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams. Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features. means we are dividing software into small, well-defined modules enables teams to use functions for multiple purposes.

🔸Benefits of Microservices :
	🔸Flexible Scaling
	🔸Easy Deployment
	🔸Technological Freedom
	🔸Reusable Code
	🔸Resilience
🌐What is Monolith architecture?

🔸A Monolith architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming. means we are not dividing software into small, well-defined modules, we use every services like, database, server or a UI of the application, in one Application file.



🌐Why do we need a useEffect Hook?

🔸useEffect Hook is javascript function provided by react. The useEffect Hook allows you to eliminate side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching API data, directly updating the DOM, and setting up subscriptions or timers, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects. useEffect accepts two arguments, a callback function and a dependency array. The second argument is optional.
	🔸useEffect(() => {}, [])
🔸The () => {} is callback function and [] is called a empty dependency array. If anything that we pass (suppose currentState) inside the [] it trigger the callback function and changes the state of the application.

	useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentState("true");
}, [currentState])

🔸If we do not pass empty dependency array then the useEffect runs everytime when the UI is rendered.

	useEffect(() => {})

🌐What is Optional Chaining?

🔸Optional Chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is undefined or null , it returns undefined instead of throwing an error. Optional Chaining (?.) is good way of accessing the object keys, it prevents the application from being crashed if the key that we are trying to access is not present. If the key is not present then instead of a throwing key error, it returns undefined.


🌐What is Shimmer UI?

🔸A Shimmer UI resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (while UI currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load. Shimmer UI is a great way for loading the applications. Instead of showing a loading circle we can design a shimmer UI for our application that is good for user experience.


🌐What is CORS?

🔸Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.

🌐 What is async and await?

🔸Async: It simply allows us to write promises-based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread. It operates asynchronously via the event loop. Async functions will always return a promise. It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then JavaScript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value. Await: Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.
